# FERM
Coursera Financial Engineering and Risk Management Columbia University

I am working on the material in these excellent and challenging courses. 
I will be adding more code and solutions to quizzes as I get through them.

About the code, I did not go crazy with templates and class hierarchies, I wanted the focus to be 
about learning financial engineering and not C++. So the implementations are bare bones but functional.

The VS 2017 solution requires Eigen 3.3.3 Nuget package by oneZeroPlus.
Eigen library is used to solve the linear equations arising out option's replicating portfolio (week 3)

You could just run the executable FERM1.exe instead of setting up the solution.
